// Note regarding pop-ups and ajax calls
//  - A standard function should be provided here for making AJAX requests
//      - Ajax requests should relate to a tile.
//      - Ajax requests should respond with { return_code, skinned_tile_html, popup_data }
//  - Pop-up renderer classes should be instantiated per tile that they relate to
//      - They should include an applyData() method, called both at initialisation time and to apply AJAX responses
//
