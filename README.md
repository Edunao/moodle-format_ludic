# Introduction
LUDIC is a Moodle course format plugin, resulting from research work in gamifictaion, that presents course structure and contents graphically. Images are dynamic, evolving over time to emphasise student achievement.

## Look and Feel
The objective is provide a light-weight navigation experience, favoring large images over long texts.

## Philosophy
This plugin is designed to be extremely easy to use, requiring only minimal input from the course creators in order to put it to use.
The plugin includes a set of dynamic skins for sections and activities that can be used out of the box. It is possible for a user to create their own dynamic skins but it should be noted that this feature currently requires some technical expertise.

## Course structure
Ludic courses use a classic Moodle structure with content organised into a set of course sections.
A course overview page presents the sections to which the student currently has access.
The content for each separate section is displayed in it's own dedicated page.

## Dynamic section skins
Each section, as represented in the course overview page, is dressed in a dynamic skin. The course creator can choose which skin to use for which section, selecting from a range of options provided out of the box and any additional skins that they have added themselves.

## Dynamic content skins
Each activity and resource may either be presented 'inline', displayed as it would be in any other Moodle course format, or may be represented by a dynamic skin that is conceptually similar to the section skins described above.

## History & Credits
LUDIC was developped by EDUNAO as part of the LudiMoodle research project. The LudMoodle project, involving researchers from the Universit√© de Lyon and the LIRIS, investigated the impact of different gamification techniques on user engagement for users with different motivation profiles.
